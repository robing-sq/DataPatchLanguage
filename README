The DPL System project was part of a Masters
thesis. The project has not been updated 
since 2012 but if your system meets all the
requirements it should run properly.

----------------------
   	About
----------------------

DPL hot patches the data structures
of running applications. 

This system is designed to infer data 
structures from a running process by 
looking at its compilation metadata. 
The idea is to then apply a touring 
complete domain specific language to 
update these data structures. This is 
all done while the process is still 
running.

----------------------
      Requirements
----------------------

1) Intel's Pin x86 Dynamic Library
2) MySQL database
3) LibDwarf
4) Compile with gcc + debugging symbols available

----------------------
Command Line Arguments
----------------------

To run the DPL program you will need to use
the following command:

	./MEMIE.o -p processID
